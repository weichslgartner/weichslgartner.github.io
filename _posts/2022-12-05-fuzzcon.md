I gave a Talk about historical vulnerabilities in the automotive space at FuzzCon Europe Automotive Edition 2022. I showed some classical car hacks and exemplified how software testing methodologies such as fuzzing or static analysis could have detected them.  You can find the [slides](andreas_weichslgartner_fuzzcon.pdf) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9C9_ipD3HI) online.
All my publications can be found in the [
    publications section](/publications).
