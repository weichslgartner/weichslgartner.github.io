I made a little write up for the interactive Covid-19 dashboard I created in Python 
with Bokeh, Pandas, Numpy etc.
The content ranges from the getting the data, preprocessing it with pandas to creating 
an interactive plots with Bokeh, creating a Rest-Api, and finally hosting it on the internet.
You can find the write up [in the project section](/dashboard), the hosted live version at [heroku](https://covid-19-bokeh-dashboard.herokuapp.com/dashboard), and all the source code at [github](https://github.com/weichslgartner/covid_dashboard).
