I did some quick write up for the Kicker Manager game optimizer.
The goal of this popular game in Germany is to select a team of real Bundesliga players with a given budget to yield maximal points.
The write up can be found [here](/projects) and the sources are on [github](https://github.com/weichslgartner/KickerManagerspiel).
