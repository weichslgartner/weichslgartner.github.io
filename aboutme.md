My name is Andreas Weichslgartner and I am currently working as developer for Audi Electronic Ventures GmbH in the area of machine learning, AI, and security. Before, I was working as a researcher at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) and obtained my PhD in computer science there. I am interested in machine learning, AI, FPGAs, embedded systems, networks on chips, Python, Java.

In my spare time, I like to watch and play music, cook, and travel.
